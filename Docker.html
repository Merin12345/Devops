<h1> DOCKER</h1>
<p>
Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications.</p>
<br>
<p>Developers can create containers without Docker, but the platform makes it easier, simpler, and safer to build, deploy and manage containers. Docker is essentially a toolkit that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands and work-saving automation through a single API.</p>
